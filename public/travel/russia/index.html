            <h2>Moscow's Imperial Power</h2>
            <p>Red Square anchors Moscow with the Kremlin's fortress walls, St. Basil's Cathedral's colorful onion domes, and Lenin's Mausoleum representing different eras of Russian power. The Kremlin houses government offices and museums displaying imperial treasures, while GUM department store offers luxury shopping in a historic arcade. Moscow's metro system features palatial stations with marble, mosaics, and chandeliers that demonstrate Soviet architectural ambition.</p>
            
            <h2>St. Petersburg's Elegance</h2>
            <p>St. Petersburg showcases European-influenced architecture through the Winter Palace's Hermitage Museum, one of the world's largest art collections housed in opulent imperial rooms. The city's canals, bridges, and neoclassical buildings earned it the nickname "Venice of the North." White Nights during summer provide nearly 24-hour daylight for exploring palaces, gardens, and cultural sites that reflect Peter the Great's vision of a European capital.</p>
            
            <h2>Trans-Siberian Railway</h2>
            <p>The Trans-Siberian Railway offers one of the world's great train journeys, crossing 9,289 kilometers from Moscow to Vladivostok through diverse landscapes including forests, steppes, mountains, and Lake Baikal. This epic journey provides glimpses of Russian life in small towns and cities while crossing multiple time zones. Stops include Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk, and other historic cities that tell Russia's expansion story.</p>
            
            <h2>Lake Baikal</h2>
            <p>Lake Baikal contains 20% of the world's fresh water in the deepest and oldest lake on Earth, surrounded by pristine wilderness and unique ecosystems. The lake offers hiking, fishing, and wildlife viewing opportunities, while winter transforms it into a frozen wonderland for ice walking and dog sledding. Local Buryat culture adds indigenous perspectives to this UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
            
            <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
            <p>Russian culture encompasses literature (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky), classical music (Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky), and ballet (Bolshoi, Mariinsky) that influence global arts. Orthodox churches with golden domes and icon paintings demonstrate religious traditions, while Soviet-era monuments and museums provide historical context. Traditional crafts like matryoshka dolls and lacquer boxes continue folk art traditions.</p>
            
            <h2>Siberian Wilderness</h2>
            <p>Siberia's vast forests, tundra, and mountain ranges offer adventure travel opportunities including wildlife viewing, fishing, and cultural exchanges with indigenous peoples. The region's extreme climate and isolation create unique ecosystems and traditional lifestyles adapted to harsh conditions. These experiences provide insights into Russia's frontier heritage and relationship with nature's extremes.</p>
