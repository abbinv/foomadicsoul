            <h2>Rocky Mountain Majesty</h2>
            <p>The Canadian Rockies showcase dramatic peaks, turquoise lakes, and abundant wildlife in Banff and Jasper National Parks.

These parks preserve pristine ecosystems while offering world-class outdoor recreation.</p>
            
            <h2>Vibrant Cities</h2>
            <p>Toronto combines multicultural neighborhoods, world-class museums, and the iconic CN Tower with diverse dining scenes reflecting global immigration. Vancouver balances urban sophistication with outdoor access, offering mountains, ocean, and forests within the city limits. Montreal preserves French culture in North America with cobblestone streets, European architecture, and vibrant arts scenes that celebrate Quebec's unique heritage.</p>
            
            <h2>Maritime Provinces</h2>
            <p>Atlantic Canada offers rugged coastlines, lighthouse-dotted shores, and maritime culture centered on fishing traditions and Celtic heritage.

            <h2>Indigenous Culture</h2>
            <p>First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis cultures contribute rich traditions through art, storytelling, and cultural centers that share indigenous perspectives on Canadian history and contemporary life. Traditional experiences include powwows, cultural performances, and learning about sustainable relationships with nature that indigenous peoples maintained for thousands of years before European contact.</p>
            
            <h2>Seasonal Experiences</h2>
            <p>Canada's four distinct seasons create varied travel experiences: summer's midnight sun and outdoor festivals, autumn's spectacular fall colors, winter's snow sports and ice hotels, and spring's wildlife emergence and maple syrup production. Each season offers unique activities and landscapes that showcase Canada's climate diversity and seasonal beauty across different regions and provinces.</p>
