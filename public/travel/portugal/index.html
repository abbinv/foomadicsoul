            <h2>Lisbon's Vibrant Culture</h2>
            <p>Lisbon's seven hills offer stunning viewpoints over red-tiled roofs and the Tagus River, while historic trams navigate steep cobblestone streets through neighborhoods like Alfama's fado houses and Bairro Alto's nightlife. The city combines Manueline architecture in BelÃ©m's monuments with contemporary culture in LX Factory's creative spaces. Pastries, coffee culture, and outdoor dining create relaxed atmospheres that define Portuguese lifestyle.</p>
            
            <h2>Porto's Wine Heritage</h2>
            <p>Porto's UNESCO World Heritage center features medieval streets, baroque churches, and the iconic Dom LuÃ­s I Bridge spanning the Douro River. Vila Nova de Gaia's port wine cellars offer tastings of Portugal's famous fortified wine, while the city's azulejo tile decorations create artistic facades throughout historic districts. Modern attractions include contemporary art museums and innovative restaurants that blend tradition with creativity.</p>
            
            <h2>Algarve's Golden Coast</h2>
            <p>The Algarve's dramatic coastline features golden cliffs, hidden beaches, and fishing villages that maintain traditional character despite tourism development. Lagos' Ponta da Piedade offers spectacular rock formations and sea caves, while Tavira preserves authentic Portuguese architecture and culture. Golf courses, water sports, and coastal hiking provide outdoor activities amid year-round sunshine and Atlantic breezes.</p>
            
            <h2>Historic Towns</h2>
            <p>Ã“bidos' medieval walls encircle a perfectly preserved town with narrow streets, traditional houses, and artisan shops selling local crafts and ginja cherry liqueur. Sintra's romantic palaces and gardens, including the colorful Pena Palace, create fairy-tale settings in forested hills near Lisbon. These towns demonstrate Portugal's architectural heritage and artistic traditions preserved through centuries.</p>
            
            <h2>Maritime Legacy</h2>
            <p>Portugal's Age of Discovery heritage appears in monuments, museums, and cultural sites that celebrate explorers like Vasco da Gama and Prince Henry the Navigator. Coastal fortresses, maritime museums, and traditional fishing communities preserve connections to the sea that shaped Portuguese identity. This heritage influences cuisine, culture, and the national character that embraces global connections.</p>
            
            <h2>Natural Beauty</h2>
            <p>Portugal's diverse landscapes include the Douro Valley's terraced vineyards, Peneda-GerÃªs National Park's wilderness, and Azores' volcanic islands with hot springs and crater lakes. Each region offers distinct experiences from mountain hiking and river cruises to island hopping and whale watching, showcasing Portugal's natural diversity beyond its famous coastline.</p>
