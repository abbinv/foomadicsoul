            <h2>Dubrovnik's Medieval Majesty</h2>
            <p>Dubrovnik's UNESCO World Heritage walls encircle a perfectly preserved medieval city with limestone streets, baroque churches, and Renaissance palaces that earned it the nickname "Pearl of the Adriatic." The city walls offer spectacular views over red-tiled roofs and azure waters, while cable car rides provide panoramic vistas. Game of Thrones filming locations add contemporary appeal to this historic maritime republic.</p>
            
            <h2>Island Paradise</h2>
            <p>Croatian islands offer diverse experiences: Hvar's lavender fields and nightlife, Korƒçula's medieval architecture and wine traditions, and Braƒç's famous Zlatni Rat beach that changes shape with tides and winds. Island-hopping by ferry or private boat reveals hidden coves, traditional fishing villages, and crystal-clear waters perfect for swimming, snorkeling, and sailing adventures.</p>
            
            <h2>Plitvice Lakes Wonder</h2>
            <p>Plitvice Lakes National Park showcases 16 terraced lakes connected by waterfalls and cascades through pristine forests that change colors with seasons. Wooden walkways allow close encounters with turquoise waters and diverse wildlife while protecting this UNESCO World Heritage ecosystem. The park demonstrates Croatia's commitment to natural conservation and sustainable tourism.</p>
            
            <h2>Historic Coastal Cities</h2>
            <p>Split's Diocletian's Palace integrates Roman ruins with modern life as residents live and work within ancient walls, creating unique urban archaeology. Zadar's Roman forum, medieval churches, and contemporary Sea Organ installation that creates music from waves demonstrate layers of Croatian history and innovation. These cities balance preservation with vibrant contemporary culture.</p>
            
            <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
            <p>Croatian culture reflects influences from Roman, Venetian, Austrian, and Ottoman civilizations through architecture, cuisine, and traditions that vary by region. Traditional klapa singing, folk dances, and festivals preserve local customs while contemporary arts, music, and literature contribute to European cultural dialogue. This diversity creates rich cultural experiences throughout the country.</p>
            
            <h2>Natural Diversity</h2>
            <p>Beyond coastlines, Croatia offers diverse landscapes including Krka National Park's waterfalls, Paklenica's mountain hiking, and Istria's truffle forests and wine regions. Each area provides distinct experiences from adventure sports and wildlife viewing to culinary tourism and rural agritourism that showcase Croatia's geographical and cultural variety within a compact, accessible country.</p>
