            <p>Portuguese cuisine reflects the nation's maritime heritage and global exploration history, combining Atlantic seafood with influences from former colonies in Brazil, Africa, and Asia. This coastal cuisine emphasizes fresh ingredients, simple preparations, and bold flavors that celebrate Portugal's position as a seafaring nation and cultural bridge between continents.</p>

            <h2>Bacalhau Mastery</h2>
            <p>Cod (bacalhau) holds legendary status in Portuguese cuisine, with claims of 365 different preparations - one for each day of the year. Salt-cured cod became essential during Portugal's Age of Discovery, providing protein for long sea voyages. Classic preparations include bacalhau √† br√°s with eggs and potatoes, and bacalhau com natas in cream sauce.</p>
            
            <h2>Past√©is de Nata Excellence</h2>
            <p>Portugal's iconic custard tarts originated in Bel√©m's Jer√≥nimos Monastery, where monks created the secret recipe still used today. These flaky pastries with caramelized custard centers represent Portuguese pastry mastery, requiring precise temperature control and timing to achieve the perfect balance of crispy exterior and creamy interior.</p>
            
            <h2>Seafood Abundance</h2>
            <p>Portugal's extensive coastline provides exceptional seafood, from grilled sardines during summer festivals to cataplana seafood stews in copper pans. Fresh fish markets offer daily catches, while traditional preparations like caldeirada (fisherman's stew) and a√ßorda de marisco (seafood bread soup) showcase regional coastal cooking techniques.</p>
            
            <h2>Wine Heritage</h2>
            <p>Portuguese wine regions produce distinctive varieties like Vinho Verde's light, refreshing wines and Port's fortified sweetness from the Douro Valley. Indigenous grape varieties create unique flavor profiles, while traditional winemaking methods in regions like D√£o and Alentejo produce wines that perfectly complement Portuguese cuisine's seafood focus.</p>
            
            <h2>Colonial Influences</h2>
            <p>Portugal's colonial history introduced spices, techniques, and ingredients that enriched the national cuisine. Piri-piri peppers from Africa, tempura techniques from Japan via Macau, and tropical fruits from Brazil created fusion dishes that demonstrate Portugal's role in global culinary exchange throughout history.</p>
            
            <h2>Regional Traditions</h2>
            <p>Northern Portugal offers hearty meat dishes and vinho verde, central regions provide roasted meats and strong cheeses, while the Algarve specializes in seafood and almond-based sweets. Each region's climate, geography, and cultural influences created distinct culinary identities within Portuguese cuisine's unified coastal character.</p>
