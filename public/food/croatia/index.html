            <h2>Adriatic Seafood Excellence</h2>
            <p>Croatia's pristine Adriatic coastline provides exceptional seafood including fresh fish, shellfish, and crustaceans. Traditional preparations like brodetto (fish stew), grilled fish with olive oil and herbs, and black risotto with cuttlefish ink showcase simple techniques that highlight natural flavors. Coastal restaurants often serve catch-of-the-day selections prepared with minimal seasoning.</p>
            
            <h2>Istrian Truffle Treasures</h2>
            <p>Istria's truffle-rich forests produce both white and black truffles that rival Italian varieties. Traditional truffle hunting with trained dogs continues ancient practices, while modern restaurants create innovative dishes featuring these prized fungi. Istrian cuisine also includes excellent olive oils, wines, and pasta dishes that reflect Italian influences.</p>
            
            <h2>Continental Comfort Foods</h2>
            <p>Inland Croatia offers hearty dishes influenced by Austrian and Hungarian cuisines: ≈°trukli (cheese pastry), ƒçobanac (spicy meat stew), and various sausage preparations. These substantial dishes reflect agricultural traditions and provide comfort during cold continental winters, using local meats, vegetables, and preservation techniques.</p>
            
            <h2>Island Specialties</h2>
            <p>Croatian islands each offer unique culinary identities: Pag's famous sheep cheese, Vis's traditional fishing recipes, Hvar's lavender-infused dishes, and Korƒçula's wine traditions. Island isolation preserved ancient recipes and techniques while creating distinct flavor profiles that reflect local ingredients and maritime influences.</p>
            
            <h2>Wine Heritage</h2>
            <p>Croatia produces exceptional wines from indigenous grape varieties like Plavac Mali and Malvazija Istarska, along with international varieties. Wine regions include Istria's sophisticated whites, Dalmatia's robust reds, and continental areas' diverse offerings. Traditional wine cellars and modern wineries showcase Croatia's viticultural potential.</p>
            
            <h2>Traditional Preservation</h2>
            <p>Croatian cuisine excels in food preservation through smoking, curing, and drying techniques. Pr≈°ut (prosciutto) from Istria and Dalmatia, various smoked fish preparations, and preserved vegetables sustained communities through winter months while creating distinctive flavors that define Croatian taste preferences and culinary identity.</p>
