            <p>Moroccan cuisine represents a sophisticated blend of Berber, Arab, Andalusian, and French influences, creating aromatic dishes that engage all senses. Known for complex spice blends, slow-cooking techniques, and the balance of sweet and savory flavors, Moroccan cooking reflects the country's position as a cultural crossroads between Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.</p>

            <h2>Tagine Mastery</h2>
            <p>The conical tagine pot creates unique cooking conditions, with steam circulating to keep ingredients moist while concentrating flavors. Classic combinations include chicken with preserved lemons and olives, lamb with apricots and almonds, and vegetable tagines with seasonal produce. The slow-cooking process allows spices to meld while maintaining ingredient integrity.</p>
            
            <h2>Spice Alchemy</h2>
            <p>Ras el hanout, Morocco's signature spice blend, can contain 30+ ingredients including rose petals, cinnamon, cumin, and ras el hanout varies by region and family recipes. Other essential spices include harissa for heat, preserved lemons for tang, and argan oil for nutty richness. Moroccan cooks balance these complex flavors with masterful precision.</p>
            
            <h2>Couscous Tradition</h2>
            <p>Friday couscous represents Morocco's most important meal, with families gathering to share steamed semolina grains topped with vegetables, meat, and aromatic broth. Hand-rolling couscous requires skill passed through generations, while the traditional couscoussier pot ensures perfect texture. Regional variations include sweet couscous with cinnamon and almonds.</p>
            
            <h2>Mint Tea Ceremony</h2>
            <p>Moroccan mint tea (atay) involves elaborate preparation rituals that demonstrate hospitality and respect. Green tea, fresh mint, and sugar are combined in specific proportions, then poured from height to create foam. The ceremony includes three glasses, each with different strength, following the saying "the first glass is as gentle as life, the second as strong as love, the third as bitter as death."</p>
            
            <h2>Pastry Excellence</h2>
            <p>Moroccan pastries showcase the cuisine's sweet sophistication, from honey-soaked chebakia during Ramadan to almond-filled gazelle horns and rose-scented ma'amoul. Pastilla, a savory-sweet pie with pigeon or chicken, demonstrates the Moroccan mastery of balancing contrasting flavors within delicate phyllo pastry layers.</p>
