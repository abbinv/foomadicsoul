            <h2>Afternoon Tea Tradition</h2>
            <p>Afternoon tea, introduced by Anna, Duchess of Bedford in 1840, features delicate finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and petit fours served with fine tea. This elegant ritual represents British hospitality and social customs, with proper etiquette governing everything from tea pouring to scone preparation, maintaining traditions across generations.</p>
