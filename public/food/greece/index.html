            <p>Greek cuisine forms the foundation of Mediterranean cooking, emphasizing fresh ingredients, olive oil, and herbs in dishes that have nourished civilizations for over 4,000 years. From ancient symposiums to modern tavernas, Greek food culture celebrates communal dining, seasonal ingredients, and the philosophy that food is medicine.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Culinary Roots</h2>
            <p>Greek cuisine traces back to ancient times when Archestratos wrote the first cookbook and symposiums combined food with philosophical discussion. The Mediterranean triad of wheat, olives, and grapes formed civilization's foundation, while herbs like oregano, thyme, and mint grew wild on Greek hillsides, flavoring dishes naturally.</p>
            
            <h2>Olive Oil Excellence</h2>
            <p>Greece produces some of the world's finest extra virgin olive oil, with varieties like Koroneiki offering intense flavor and health benefits. Olive oil isn't just cooking fat but a flavor enhancer used generously in salads, drizzled over vegetables, and incorporated into desserts. Many Greek families maintain ancestral olive groves, pressing oil using traditional methods.</p>
            
            <h2>Mezze Culture</h2>
            <p>Mezze dining encourages leisurely meals with small plates designed for sharing and conversation. Classic mezze includes dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), spanakopita (spinach pie), tzatziki with fresh herbs, grilled octopus, and various dips like melitzanosalata (eggplant) and tirokafteri (spicy cheese). Each region offers unique mezze reflecting local ingredients.</p>

            <h2>Island Specialties</h2>
            <p>Greek islands offer distinct culinary identities: Santorini's volcanic soil produces unique tomatoes and wines, Crete contributes rusks and graviera cheese, Mykonos offers fresh seafood and kopanisti cheese, while Corfu shows Venetian influences in its cuisine. Each island's isolation created unique flavor profiles and cooking techniques.</p>
            
            <h2>Traditional Techniques</h2>
            <p>Greek cooking employs time-honored methods like slow-braising in clay pots, grilling over charcoal, and preserving foods in olive oil. Phyllo pastry requires skill to roll paper-thin sheets for baklava and savory pies, while cheese-making traditions produce feta, kasseri, and graviera using methods unchanged for centuries.</p>
            
            <h2>Seasonal Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Greek cuisine follows Orthodox fasting periods, creating a rich tradition of plant-based dishes that highlight vegetables, legumes, and grains. Lenten recipes like fasolada (bean soup) and gemista (stuffed vegetables) prove that Greek vegetarian cuisine offers satisfying, flavorful meals rooted in religious and agricultural traditions.</p>
